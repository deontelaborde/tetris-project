### **_Description_**

## Who doesn't love the classic arcade game Tetris?! We will play the game that has been brought down from generations to generations.

### **_Technologies Used_**

### **_Get Started_**

This game will be following the classic rules of the game.
Rules:

- Use the controls for move block peices laterally while they are falling to the ground.
  - You can rotate the peices as you see "fit."
- Completing rows to increase your score and keep your pile down.
  - Failure to do so results in game over and you can try again.
